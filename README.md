# VSDS-VD: benchmarking AI-powered docking methods from the perspective of virtual screening

## Introduction

Boltz is a family of models for biomolecular interaction prediction. Boltz-1 was the first fully open source model to approach AlphaFold3 accuracy. Our latest work Boltz-2 is a new biomolecular foundation model that goes beyond AlphaFold3 and Boltz-1 by jointly modeling complex structures and binding affinities, a critical component towards accurate molecular design. Boltz-2 is the first deep learning model to approach the accuracy of physics-based free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods, while running 1000x faster â€” making accurate in silico screening practical for early-stage drug discovery.

All the code and weights are provided under MIT license, making them freely available for both academic and commercial uses. For more information about the model, see the [Boltz-1](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.19.624167) and [Boltz-2](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.14.659707) technical reports.

## Installation

> Note: we recommend installing boltz in a fresh python environment

Install boltz with PyPI (recommended):

```
pip install boltz -U
```

or directly from GitHub for daily updates:

```
git clone https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz.git
cd boltz; pip install -e .
```

## Inference

You can run inference using Boltz with:

```
boltz predict input_path --use_msa_server
```

`input_path` should point to a YAML file, or a directory of YAML files for batched processing, describing the biomolecules you want to model and the properties you want to predict (e.g. affinity). To see all available options: `boltz predict --help` and for more information on these input formats, see our [prediction instructions](docs/prediction.md). By default, the `boltz` command will run the latest version of the model.
